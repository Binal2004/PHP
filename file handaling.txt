  -> PHP readfile() Function :- 
    -> syntax :- 
      readfile(filename, use_include_path, context);

     -> e.g

	    <?php
			echo readfile("file_name.txt");
		?>
 
  -> PHP Open File - fopen()
   -> E.g :- 
     
     <?php
		$myfile = fopen("file_name.txt", "r") or die("Unable to open file!");
		echo fread($myfile,filesize("file_name.txt"));
		fclose($myfile);
	 ?>
 

  -> PHP Read File - fread() :- 
     -> The fread() function reads from an open file.
  
	   -> syntax :- 
	     fread($myfile,filesize("webdictionary.txt"));

  -> PHP Close File - fclose() :- 
	-> The fclose() function is used to close an open file. 
   
    -> syntax :- 
		
		<?php
			$myfile = fopen("webdictionary.txt", "r");
			// some code to be executed....
			fclose($myfile);
		?>


  -> PHP Read Single Line - fgets() :- 
      -> The fgets() function is used to read a single line from a file.

  -> Eg. 
	   <?php
		$myfile = fopen("webdictionary.txt", "r") or die("Unable to open file!");
		echo fgets($myfile);
		fclose($myfile);
	   ?>


  -> PHP Check End-Of-File - feof() :- 
      -> The feof() function checks if the "end-of-file" (EOF) has been reached.

  -> Eg. 
	     <?php
			$myfile = fopen("webdictionary.txt", "r") or die("Unable to open file!");
			// Output one line until end-of-file
			while(!feof($myfile)) {
			  echo fgets($myfile) . "<br>";
			}
			fclose($myfile);
		?>


 -> PHP Read Single Character - fgetc() :- 
     -> The fgetc() function is used to read a single character from a file.

  -> Eg. 
  
	    <?php

			// Output one character until end-of-file
			while(!feof($myfile)) {
			  echo fgetc($myfile);
			}
			fclose($myfile);
		?>    		



 -> PHP Create File - fopen() :- 
    -> fopen() on a file that does not exist, it will create it, given that the file is opened for writing (w) or appending (a).

	  -> Syntax :- 
	     $myfile = fopen("testfile.txt", "w")

 -> PHP Write to File - fwrite() :- 
	 -> The fwrite() function is used to write to a file. 

   ->E.g :- 
	    <?php
			$myfile = fopen("newfile.txt", "w") or die("Unable to open file!");
			$txt = "John Doe\n";
			fwrite($myfile, $txt);
			$txt = "Jane Doe\n";
			fwrite($myfile, $txt);
			fclose($myfile);
		?>

 -> PHP Overwriting :- 

   -> <?php
		$myfile = fopen("newfile.txt", "w") or die("Unable to open file!");
		$txt = "Mickey Mouse\n";
		fwrite($myfile, $txt);
		$txt = "Minnie Mouse\n";
		fwrite($myfile, $txt);
		fclose($myfile);
	 ?>
